# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## projectmem (MANDATORY)

This project uses projectmem for persistent memory + workflow rules.

This project is registered with projectmem as **jacket-ai**.
Pass `project="jacket-ai"` on any projectmem tool call.

SESSION START — call these three MCP tools, in this order, BEFORE
answering ANY question about this project:

  1. `get_instructions()` — loads the project's mandatory workflow
     rules. Without this you will not know how to log work
     correctly, when to use `add_note` vs `add_decision`, or how
     the event log is structured.
  2. `get_summary()` — loads project content. Do NOT answer from
     conversation history or by re-reading package.json / README /
     source files.
  3. `get_project_map()` — loads structural layout when relevant.

BEFORE modifying ANY file:
  - Call `precheck_file(path)` — check failure history first.

DURING work — use MCP write tools, NEVER edit `.projectmem/`
files directly via filesystem write:
  - On a bug discovery → `log_issue(summary, location)`.
  - After each fix attempt → `record_attempt(summary, outcome)`.
  - After confirmation → `record_fix(summary)`.
  - On a design choice → `add_decision(summary)`.
  - On a gotcha / setup detail → `add_note(summary)`.
  - When a new decision REPLACES an older one → pass
    `supersedes="<old event id>"` to `add_decision`. The log stays
    append-only; the old decision is tagged retired and drops out of
    summary.md, so the summary never shows two answers to the same
    question. Get ids from `get_summary()` or `search_events()`.

Editing `.projectmem/summary.md` or `.projectmem/PROJECT_MAP.md`
directly bypasses event logging and breaks audit replay. The
summary file regenerates from `events.jsonl` automatically — write
via the MCP tools and the summary will follow.

Do not re-scan source files when MCP tools can give you the same
answer in ~500 tokens instead of ~5000. This is not optional.
